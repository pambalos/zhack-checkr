Checkr Application

To get it to run, open this directory in command line and type:
python main.py
If it does not work, you will see an error message like 'flask' not found, 
if you get that error, you need to run
pip install (package name)
Ie
pip install flask

Once you have it running, you should see an address like 'http://localhost:127.0.0.1/', just copy and paste that into your browser.
